## My process
I first work with html. I add the images, then I define header, main and footer. Next I define sections in main. Then, I divide the content using divs based on the layout. Finally, I assign the heading, paragraph or anchor tags as required to the text. The social media icons I,ve gotten from fontawesome. To change the color of the logo in footer, I change the fill value in svg code of the image. 

Then I define colors as variables, font-family, weights, sizes from style guide file. Then I go from top to button. First I complete mobile design. There, I change the display to flex wherever required, then colors, then fonts and finally I work with margins, paddings and spacing of each section.

In desktop design, I first change the flex-direction to row wherever required. After that I stop for the day. Next day, I work on font-sizes and spacing of each secion from top to bottom. Finally, I add box-shadows and active states of CTA elements.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

I have used BEM class naming convention in CSS for the first-time.

### Continued development

I would like to further decrease the development time. Font-sizes and spacing are the two  most time-consuming tasks.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Box Shadow](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/) - This helped me to understand box-shadow parameters.
- [BEM](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand BEM. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
